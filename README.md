# With Great Growth, Comes Greater Consumption: Energy Consumption of Countries Around the world in Relation to Their annual GDP growth
An analysis of economic growth and energy consumption globally between 1992 to 2022

## Overview

This study explores the relationship between energy consumption and GDP growth across various income levels from 1992 to 2022 using a linear regression model. By integrating global data on energy usage in terawatt-hours and economic performance, preliminary results suggest a positive correlation between increased energy consumption and GDP growth, particularly in lower-income countries driven by industrialization. In contrast, high-income regions exhibit a nuanced relationship, possibly due to advanced energy efficiencies and shifts towards service-oriented economies. These findings emphasize the need for energy-aware economic policies that align with sustainable development goals, highlighting differentiated strategies for income groups in the face of global environmental challenge

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from X.
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.


## Statement on LLM usage

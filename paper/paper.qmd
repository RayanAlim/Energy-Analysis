# Introduction

Economic growth and energy consumption are deeply interlinked processes that influence each other in both direct and indirect ways. Historically, the economic output of a country has been closely tied to its energy usage, with periods of high growth accompanied by increases in energy consumption [@Stern-2006] This relationship is often conceptualized through the lens of the Energy-Economic Growth Nexus which posits that energy is a critical input in economic production and, conversely, economic growth can lead to increased energy consumption due to higher industrial activity, transportation needs, and residential and commercial usage [@SORRELL-2009].

Several theoretical frameworks have been proposed to explain this nexus. The most prominent among them is the Jevons Paradox, which suggests that as technological advancements increase energy efficiency, the rate of consumption of that energy may actually increase as its effective cost decreases [@ALCOTT-2005]. Conversely, the Khazzoom-Brookes postulate extends this paradox to the macroeconomic level, arguing that increased energy efficiency may lead to faster economic growth, which in turn increases total energy demand [@Saunders-1992].

Empirical studies have shown diverse results depending on the economic structure and developmental stage of the country in question. For developed nations, research has indicated a decoupling of energy consumption and economic growth, attributed to advances in energy efficiency and a shift towards service-oriented economies which are less energy-intensive [@OWEN-2006]. In contrast, developing countries tend to exhibit a strong correlation between energy consumption and GDP growth, driven by industrialization and infrastructure expansion which are highly energy-dependent [@Bhattacharyya-2019].

The policy implications of these findings are significant, as they influence national energy strategies and their alignment with economic objectives. The transition towards sustainable energy sources is also a critical factor in this equation, with renewable energy adoption seen as a key element in sustaining long-term economic growth without the environmental degradation associated with fossil fuels [@Wei-2023].

Understanding the specific dynamics of energy consumption and economic growth within the context of a particular country requires a detailed examination of its economic policies, energy resources, and technological advancements. This paper aims to explore these themes within the context of countries globally, providing insights that may help in formulating strategies for sustainable economic and energy development.

# Model

The goal of our modelling strategy is twofold. Firstly,...

Here we briefly describe the Bayesian analysis model used to investigate... Background details and diagnostics are included in [Appendix -@sec-model-details].

## Model set-up

Define $y_i$ as the number of seconds that the plane remained aloft. Then $\beta_i$ is the wing width and $\gamma_i$ is the wing length, both measured in millimeters.  

\begin{align} 
y_i|\mu_i, \sigma &\sim \mbox{Normal}(\mu_i, \sigma) \\
\mu_i &= \alpha + \beta_i + \gamma_i\\
\alpha &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\beta &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\gamma &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\sigma &\sim \mbox{Exponential}(1)
\end{align}

We run the model in R [@citeR] using the `rstanarm` package of @rstanarm. We use the default priors from `rstanarm`.


### Model justification

We expect a positive relationship between the size of the wings and time spent aloft. In particular...

We can use maths by including latex between dollar signs, for instance $\theta$.

**Dataset Abstract**

This datasheet presents a dataset combining annual GDP growth data from the World Bank and OECD National Accounts with per capita primary energy consumption data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the Energy Institute's Statistical Review of World Energy. The dataset spans from 1965 to 2022 and includes information for 266 countries, enabling analyses of the relationships between economic growth and energy usage. 

**Motivation**

1. *For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.*
    - The dataset was specifically created to examine the relationship between economic growth, measured through GDP growth rates, and energy consumption on a per capita basis across various countries and years. The intent was to analyse the link in economic metrics with energy usage statistics in an effort to understand how economic trends are related to energy consumption pattern.
    
2. *Who created the dataset (for example, which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (for example, company, institution, organization)?*
    - There are two datasets merged into one in this dataset. |The first dataset is from the  World Bank national accounts data, and OECD National Accounts data files and the second datset is from U.S. Energy Information Administration (2023), Energy Institute - Statistical Review of World Energy (2023), Population based on various sources (2023) â€“ with major processing by Our World in Data. They were merged by Rayan Awad Alim, they were merged for research purposes and the above outlined motivation.
    
3. *Who funded the creation of the dat9aset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.*
    - The collection of the data was funded by World Bank and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OCED).
    
4. *Any other comments?*
    - This dataset coule be particularly valuable for policymakers and researchers interested in the implications of economic policies on energy consumption and environmental impact.

**Composition**

1. *What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (for example, documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (for example, movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.*

2. *How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?*
	-     The dataset includes data from 1965 to 2022 for x countries, as well as by region. Each year's data for each country forms a unique instance in the dataset.
	
3. *Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).*
	- The dataset is not a sample it includes all countrries recognized by the UN aqre accounted for.
	
4. *What data does each instance consist of? "Raw" data (for example, unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.*

5. *Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.*
	- There are no explicit labels or target variables as this dataset is designed for exploratory and inferential statistical analyses rather than predictive modeling.
	
6. *Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (for example, because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, for example, redacted text.*
	- Some instances have missing data due to non-reporting countries or years where the data collection was not feasible. Missing data points are noted and are a dropped in the analysis to avoid biased interpretations.
	
7. *Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (for example, users' movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.*
	- The dataset primarily represents independent instances without explicit relational data between them

abstract: "This study explores the relationship between energy consumption and GDP growth across various income levels from 1992 to 2022 using a linear regression model. By integrating global data on energy usage in terawatt-hours and economic performance, preliminary results suggest a positive correlation between increased energy consumption and GDP growth, particularly in lower-income countries driven by industrialization. In contrast, high-income regions exhibit a nuanced relationship, possibly due to advanced energy efficiencies and shifts towards service-oriented economies. These findings emphasize the need for energy-aware economic policies that align with sustainable development goals, highlighting differentiated strategies for income groups in the face of global environmental challenges"

# Introduction

## Background And Literature Review

Economic growth and energy consumption are deeply interlinked processes that influence each other in both direct and indirect ways. Historically, the economic output of a country has been closely tied to its energy usage, with periods of high growth accompanied by increases in energy consumption [@Stern-2006] This relationship is often conceptualized through the lens of the Energy-Economic Growth Nexus which posits that energy is a critical input in economic production and, conversely, economic growth can lead to increased energy consumption due to higher industrial activity, transportation needs, and residential and commercial usage [@SORRELL-2009].

Several theoretical frameworks have been proposed to explain this nexus. The most prominent among them is the Jevons Paradox, which suggests that as technological advancements increase energy efficiency, the rate of consumption of that energy may actually increase as its effective cost decreases [@ALCOTT-2005]. Conversely, the Khazzoom-Brookes postulate extends this paradox to the macroeconomic level, arguing that increased energy efficiency may lead to faster economic growth, which in turn increases total energy demand [@Saunders-1992].

Empirical studies have shown diverse results depending on the economic structure and developmental stage of the country in question. For developed nations, research has indicated a decoupling of energy consumption and economic growth, attributed to advances in energy efficiency and a shift towards service-oriented economies which are less energy-intensive [@OWEN-2006]. In contrast, developing countries tend to exhibit a strong correlation between energy consumption and GDP growth, driven by industrialization and infrastructure expansion which are highly energy-dependent [@Bhattacharyya-2019].

## Motivation
The policy implications of these findings are significant, as they influence national energy strategies and their alignment with economic objectives. The transition towards sustainable energy sources is also a critical factor in this equation, with renewable energy adoption seen as a key element in sustaining long-term economic growth without the environmental degradation associated with fossil fuels [@Wei-2023].

Understanding the specific dynamics of energy consumption and economic growth within the context of a particular country requires a detailed examination of its economic policies, energy resources, and technological advancements. This paper aims to explore these themes within the context of countries globally, providing insights that may help in formulating strategies for sustainable economic and energy development.

# Data {#sec-data}

## Dataset

The dataset used in this study encompasses annual data from 1992 to 2022, sourced from reputable international databases including the World Bank, OECD National Accounts, U.S. Energy Information Administration, and the Energy Institute's Statistical Review of World Energy. It comprises information on GDP growth rates and total energy consumption, measured in terawatt-hours (TWh), for a diverse set of countries globally. The dataset is organized by country-year pairs, enabling analyses of the relationship between economic growth and energy usage across different income levels. Quality assurance measures were implemented to handle missing data and ensure consistency across variables, all data handling, explained in datasheet in appendix A.

The analysis was carried out using the statistical programming language `R` [@citeR], using the `tidyverse`[@cite_tool_tidyverse], `here`[@cite_tool_here], `dplyr`[@cite_tool_dplyr],   and `readr`[@cite_tool_readr] packages. The figures and tables in the paper are generated using the, respectively, `ggplot2`[@cite_tool_ggplot2] and `knitr`[@cite_tool_knitr] packages. Other packages used include `kableextra`[@cite_tool_kableextra],

# Model

Our models goal is to  to understand the dynamics between energy consumption and economic growth across various nations and years. Recognizing the critical role of energy in economic development, this analysis seeks to quantify the extent to which changes in energy consumption influence GDP growth.

## Model set-up

We make use of a linear regression model to investigate this relationship, formalized as follows:

$$
GDP\_growth_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times Energy\_consumption_{it} + \epsilon_{it}
$$

Where:

$$GDP\_growth_{it}$$
- The GDP growth rate (%) for country \(i\) in year \(t\).
$$Energy\_consumption_{it}$$
- The primary energy consumption (in terawatt-hours, TWh) for country \(i\) in year \(t\).
 $$\beta_0$$
 - The intercept term, representing the baseline GDP growth when energy consumption is zero.
$$\beta_1$$
- The coefficient of energy consumption, reflecting the change in GDP growth rate associated with a one-unit increase in energy consumption.
$$\epsilon_{it}$$
- The error term, capturing all other factors affecting GDP growth not included in the model.


We run the model in R [@citeR] using the `rstanarm` package of @rstanarm. We use the default priors from `rstanarm`.


### Model justification

- **Linear Assumption**: Preliminary data exploration suggested a potential linear relationship between the logarithm of energy consumption and GDP growth rates. This linear model provides a clear and interpretable framework to estimate the sensitivity of economic growth to changes in energy usage.

- **Economic Rationale**: Theoretically, energy is a fundamental input in production processes; thus, variations in energy supply are expected to directly impact economic output and growth. The linear regression model allows us to quantify this impact and provide insights valuable for policy formulation.

- **Statistical Considerations**: Linear regression is robust, widely understood, and provides comprehensive diagnostic tools to check for model assumptions. It serves as an excellent preliminary analytical tool, especially when the relationship does not involve complex interactions or non-linear dynamics.


### Model justification

- **Normality**: We assume the residuals of the regression, \( \epsilon_{it} \), are normally distributed, facilitating the use of classical statistical tests for hypothesis testing (e.g., t-tests for coefficients).
- **Independence**: Observations across years and countries are assumed to be independent of each other.
- **Homoscedasticity**: The error terms are assumed to have constant variance across different levels of energy consumption.
- **Linearity**: The relationship between GDP growth and energy consumption is presumed to be linear after appropriate transformations if required (e.g., logarithmic).

## Model Results and Discussion 

#### Model Estimation and Diagnostics

The statistical model employed in this analysis was constructed to ascertain the association between Average Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Growth and logarithmic transformation of Total Energy Consumption (TWh). Bayesian inference, implemented through Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, was utilized to estimate the posterior distributions of the model parameters. The stan_glm function in R, with a Gaussian family and identity link function, was used to facilitate the analysis, with a total posterior sample size of 4000.

**Comparison of Observed Data and Model Predictions: Posterior Predictive Check**

![](../figures/mcmc_trace_plot.png)

**Figure** *Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) trace plots for the Bayesian linear regression model parameters. The left panel displays the trace for the model's intercept, and the right panel shows the trace for the coefficient of Log_Energy_Consumption. Each plot contains four overlaid chains (Chain 1 to Chain 4), illustrated in different shades of blue. The trace plots illustrate the sampling path of the chains through the parameter space over 1000 iterations post warm-up. The plots exhibit stable convergence and adequate mixing of the chains, suggesting that the sampling process has reached equilibrium and that the posterior distributions are well-estimated.*

The primary variables included in the model were the intercept, representing the baseline level of GDP growth when energy consumption is at its logarithmic mean, and the coefficient for Log_Energy_Consumption, which indicates the degree of variability in GDP growth attributable to changes in energy consumption.

The results from the Bayesian regression analysis yielded the following parameter estimates (summarized by their posterior mean and standard deviation, with 10%, 50% (median), and 90% quantiles):
- The Intercept was estimated at 3.5, with a standard deviation of 0.2.
- The coefficient for Log_Energy_Consumption was centered around 0, with an effectively negligible standard deviation, indicating little to no linear effect of energy consumption on GDP growth in the model.

The residual error of the model (sigma) was estimated at 6.3, with a relatively small standard deviation, reflecting a consistent level of variability in GDP growth that is unexplained by the model.

#### Diagnostic Measures and Model Fit

The Mean Posterior Predictive Distribution (mean_PPD) of the outcome variable was estimated at 3.4, providing an aggregated measure of the model's predictions across all observations and serving as a diagnostic for the model's overall fit.

**Comparison of Observed Data and Model Predictions: Posterior Predictive Check**

![](../figures/pp_check_plot.png)

**Figure** *Posterior predictive check plot comparing the observed values of the outcome variable (y, in dark blue) to the replicated data (yrep, in light blue) generated from the model's posterior distribution. The sharp peak and significant overlap between the observed and replicated distributions around the zero mark demonstrate that the model's predictions closely align with the observed data, indicating an adequate fit for the central tendency of the data. The tails of the distribution should be examined for potential discrepancies between observed and predicted values.* 

Monte Carlo standard errors were found to be virtually zero for all parameters, indicating precision in the MCMC estimates. Effective sample sizes (n_eff) for the Intercept and Log_Energy_Consumption parameters were both over 4000, suggesting a sufficient number of independent samples were drawn to estimate the posterior distributions accurately. The potential scale reduction factor (Rhat) was at the optimal value of 1 for all parameters, indicating that convergence was achieved, and the chains mixed well.

#### Trace and Posterior Distribution Plots

The trace plots for both the Intercept and Log_Energy_Consumption display the MCMC sampling paths over iterations, showing dense and well-mixed chains, which are indicative of good convergence properties and reliable posterior estimates. These graphical diagnostics support the numerical evidence from the Rhat statistics.

The posterior density plots for the Intercept and Log_Energy_Consumption exhibit peaked distributions centered around their respective mean estimates, confirming the point estimates presented earlier.

**Posterior Distributions and Parameter Correlation for Bayesian Model of Energy Consumption and GDP Growth **

![](../figures/pairs_plot.png)
**Figure** *Pairs plot depicting the posterior distributions and bivariate relationships of the Bayesian linear regression model parameters. The diagonal panels show the density plots of the intercept (top left) and Log_Energy_Consumption (bottom right), both illustrating the posterior distribution of these parameters, which are unimodal and symmetric, suggesting precise estimates. The off-diagonal panels depict the scatterplot between the intercept and Log_Energy_Consumption with a fitted regression line, indicating a negligible correlation between the parameters, as shown by the horizontal trend of the fitted line and the even spread of points around it.*

#### Residuals Analysis

The residuals plot displays the spread of residuals against the predicted values, indicating the differences between observed and predicted GDP growth. The plot reveals a concentration of residuals around zero, suggesting a good model fit for most observations. However, a number of outliers can be observed, indicating instances where the model's predictions deviate substantially from the actual values. This warrants further investigation into potential sources of these discrepancies, such as non-linearity, omitted variable bias, or influential observations.

**Residual Analysis of GDP Growth Predictions from Energy Consumption Model **

![](../figures/residuals_plot.png)
**Figure** *Scatter plot of the residuals from the Bayesian linear regression model. The residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values of Average GDP Growth) are plotted against the predicted values. The concentration of points around the horizontal axis (residuals of zero) indicates that the model generally fits the data well. However, the presence of points distant from the horizontal axis reflects outliers or instances where the model has significant predictive errors, suggesting areas where model assumptions may not hold or where further model refinement is necessary.*

## Weaknesses and next steps

# Model Complexity

The linear regression model employed in this analysis assumes a linear relationship between energy consumption and GDP growth. However, the actual relationship may be more complex, involving non-linear dynamics or interaction effects. Future studies could explore better modeling technique to capture these complexities.

# Causality and Endogeneity

While the analysis identifies correlations between energy consumption and GDP growth, establishing causality requires careful consideration of potential endogeneity issues. Future research could employ instrumental variable approaches or quasi-experimental designs to mitigate endogeneity bias and provide more robust causal inference.

# Temporal Dynamics

The analysis spans from 1992 to 2022, capturing trends over time. However, economic and energy policies, technological advancements, and global events may influence the relationship between energy consumption and GDP growth differently across different time periods. Future research could explore temporal dynamics and structural breaks to understand how the relationship evolves over time.

# Policy Implications

The study highlights the need for energy-aware economic policies aligned with sustainable development goals. However, translating research findings into actionable policy recommendations requires careful consideration of political, social, and economic contexts. Future research could involve policy simulations or scenario analyses to evaluate the potential impacts of different policy interventions on energy consumption and economic growth.

# Environmental Considerations

While economic growth is important, it is essential to consider environmental sustainability and climate change implications associated with increased energy consumption. Future research could integrate environmental indicators and assess trade-offs between economic development and environmental conservation to inform more holistic policymaking.

# Cross-Country Variations

The analysis aggregates data across countries, masking a very big amount of heterogeneity in the relationship between energy consumption and GDP growth across different regions and income levels. Future research could conduct subgroup analyses or country-specific studies to better understand variations in this relationship and tailor policy recommendations accordingly.
